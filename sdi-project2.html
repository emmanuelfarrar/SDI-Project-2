<article>
<p>I am continuing with the theme of players in the game of Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn. In this story I am trying to determine the role, job, and food type/amount of the player.</p>
<p>As some may know in MMOs you can play a variety of roles so and food can give you pluses to certain stats so it is best to make sure you are using the right food for the right role for that extra push. </p>
<p>I hope you enjoy and this all makes sense.</p>
